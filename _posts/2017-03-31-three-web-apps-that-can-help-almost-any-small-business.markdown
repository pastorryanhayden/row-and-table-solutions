It wasn't too long ago that the thought of doing anything in an online "app" was totally foreign.  Websites were for information - work was done in local apps like Microsoft Word and Powerpoint.  Those days are long gone, and you can now do almost anything in a web app.

As small business people ourselves, there are a couple of web apps that we just couldn't do without.  We are super grateful to these guys for allowing us to get our work done and we think they may be able to help you to.

Here are three of the best online tools for small businesses you may not know about:

# 1. Freshbooks

[Freshbooks](http://freshbooks.com) is cloud accounting software.  It allows you to accept online payments, automate invoices, track expenses, receive invoices from sub-contractors and it even gives you a place to keep all of your client conversations in one place.  In a word - it's indispensable. Of course they also give you apps for iOS and Android so you can do this stuff on the go.

One area that Freshbooks really excels at is customer service.  In the few times I've had to contact them, I've always come away shocked at how good they are are at customer service.  You can get a real human being who has the knowledge to help you in less than three rings.  I've even had one of their employees offer to help me with data migration.

At $25 a month - Freshbooks is hard to beat.  

# 2. Canva

[Canva](http://canva.com) is an online graphic design tool designed for non-designers.  Even though I've been doing graphic design since 2001 and have just about every piece of design software you've ever heard of, I often go to Canva to design slides for upcoming events, blog and social media graphics, etc..

Canva is free, although they do offer inexpensive stock photography and a pro plan with more features.  Most people will do just fine with the free version.  They also have excellent apps for Android and iOS devices.

# 3. Dropbox Paper

[Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) is a service that allows you to sync files between computers.  It was one of the first to do what Apple, Microsoft, and Google offer through iCloud Drive, OneDrive and Google Drive.  I think Dropbox works better than any of these tools and still prefer it.

However, you don't have to trust Dropbox with your files to use this online tool.  [Dropbox Paper](http://paper.dropbox.com) is a collaborative writing tool that you can use in the browser or through an app on your phone or tablet.  

If offers several benefits over something more familiar like Microsoft Word or Google Docs:

* It's a **distraction free** enviroment.  There is almost nothing on the screen besides your text, and this allows you to focus on your writing instead of formatting.
* It has excellent **collaboration** and commenting built in - which makes it an ideal tool for collaborating on copy with clients and coworkers.  
* It records your change history and allows you to **roll back to prior versions** with ease.
* It works with **Markdown**, so if you write in that language (and an increasing ammount of people do), then you can write without ever fiddling with the screen and your text will look good.  Also, you don't HAVE to know Markdown to use it at all - which makes it an ideal tool for collaborating with folks who don't use Markdown.
* You can **export** to Word or Markdown to use your text in another program.


# (Honorable Mention) Airtable.

We had to throw this in.  We think [Airtable](http://airtable.com) is the greatest web app of all time and [we specialize in Airtable integrations](http://rowandtable.com).
