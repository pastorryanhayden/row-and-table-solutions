## Every business professional should be learning and using Airtable.

*(Don't know about Airtable? We are going to be writing a lot about it on this blog - [why not go check it out now](http://airtable.com).)*

In terms of practical uses, Airtable may be **the greatest web app of all time.** If that sounds a bit hyperbolic, bear with us.  

### Here are ten reasons you should start using it today:

# 1. It's ridiculously user friendly.

My first job was running a Microsoft Access Database for a Political Campaign (true story), and I've also built plenty of things with Filemaker in my day.  I know database products, and here is the thing: none of them are really user friendly.  *There is a reason why most people just use a spreadsheet as a database: **database software stinks**.*  No one has got it right.

That is until Airtable.  **When you compare Airtable to Access and Filemaker - it seems *childishly easy*.**  Airtable makes it so easy to setup databases, you'll find yourself using Airtable for all kinds of things you'd never open Access or Filemaker for.

P.S.  Even though it's easy, you'll find plenty of tutorials here.  Stay tuned.

# 2. It's incredibly powerful.

Just because Airtable is Fisher Price easy doesn't mean it's the database equivalent of my four year olds plastic workbench; **you can do real work on this thing**.  We have clients that have used Airtable to manage the sophisticated workflow of their video production team,  we have helped people setup industry specific CRMs with Airtable (that they've raved about), there are even people using Airtable to track their inventory.


If you can dream it up, you can probably make it in Airtable. 

# 3. You can sort of build your own mobile app.

After you create your Airtable base, you can just pull out your phone and have a pretty sweet mobile app that took you no time to make.  This means you can take inventory photos with your iPhone; without paying someone to build an app for that purpose.  You can setup a quick expense tracking base and add expenses with your phone.  You can take signups for an event with an iPad and have them go right into the database.  The uses are endless.

# 4. You can share your data online easily.

Once you have data in a base, it's a trivial 3 second task to create a read only link or an embed of that base you can share on your website or social media.  You could use Airtable to host audio, photos, or Word docs and get an entire organized and searchable library on your website in 30 seconds.  You can share a link to a view of unfished projects with a colaborator.  You could do so many things.

# 5. You can access your data on any computer.

Because Airtable is a web app and your data lives in the cloud - you don't need any special computer to manage your data.  If you want to buy a $200 mini computer for data entry in your shop - it will run Airtable.  We've run airtable without a hitch on laptops made more than ten years ago. If you want to access a base using the locked down iMac at the oil change place - you can totally work their.    

# 6. Have you heard about views?  They kind of rock!

The default Airtable view looks like a supercharged spreadsheet table, but there is a lot more their.  You can create secondary views on a base and do powerful filtering and sorting.  You can create a gallery view for a visual overview of image rich data.  You can view data with date attributes in a handy calendar view and my person favorite - you can turn a base into a very productive kanban view (i.e. roll your own trello).

# 7. You can easily create and share forms to collect data.

Airtable allows you to easily create forms which can be embeded on any website or shared as a link.  You can quickly roll out a form for an event singup and share it on facebook or on your website, or spin up a quick survey form and send it to your clients.  

# 8. They give you lots of awesome templates.

If you are having a hard time imagining how to use Airtable - they offer a ton of templates you can copy and edit. They've got everything covered from film producing to cattle ranching and lots in between.

# 9. With drag and drop uploading, it's the easiest way to get media files online.

Do you have a library of audio files, pdfs, or word docs that you want to share with the world.  Airtable is the absolute easiest way to do that.  The Airtable attachment field is so slick you'll create ways to use it in your dreams.

# 10. It can be integrated to make all kinds of stuff.

One of the most powerful things about Airtable is it's API.  A good web developer can take Airtable data and do almost anything with it.  Integrate it into a website, or use web technology to create complex apps with it.  Use it to power digital signage or power recurring documents.  The possabilities are both endless and exciting.
