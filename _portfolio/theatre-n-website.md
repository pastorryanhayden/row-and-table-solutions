Theatre N is a unique theatre located in downtown Wilmington, Delaware.  They were unsatisfied with how their upcoming films were managed on their website and hired us to integrate Airtable with their content management system so that upcoming films could be pulled from an Airtable base.

We created a base to meet their needs and created a custom plugin to integrate the Airtable data into their content management system.  We also were also able to create a monthly program using the same Airtable data, further saving the client time.
