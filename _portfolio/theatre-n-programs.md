Theatre N is a unique movie theatre in Wilmington, Delaware.  Their business relies on putting out information about upcoming movie showings. Two of the ways that they accomplish this is with a monthly program booklet printed and passed out to their customers and with their website showing up-to-date showtimes.  Before we got involved, this was a time consuming process done manually in Adobe InDesign (for the handout) or using a CMS (for the website) that required technical skill.

### Website Integration

We integrated their existing website design with a new Airtable base.  Allowing them to just keep up an Airtable database with showtimes and details that automatically updates to great looking content on their website.

### Weekly Handout

We then created an HTML page with print CSS styles to exactly mirror what they had been doing in InDesign, and then created a custom plugin to send that page to a service and receive it back as a PDF - rendering the creation of this monthly program almost automatic and saving the client multiple man-hours every week while insuring consistency.
