This is a project we did for our local church to automate and help organize their prayer requests. &nbsp;The church secretary takes down prayer requests in Airtable (they can also be added with a web form) and a weekly handout is automatically generated to be passed out to church members. &nbsp;This reduces a task that used to require an hour every week of some ones time to less than five minutes while greatly improving the process and result.
