Short Order/The Kitchen is a video production firm located in Wilmington, Delaware that specializes in creating awesome commercials. &nbsp;They've produced commercials for some of America's best known brands including AAA, Comcast Business and Barclays.

The team at the Kitchen uses Airtable to manage their projects and wanted a custom web app to take that Airtable data and make it more accessible to both their team and their clients. &nbsp;We are creating a custom dashboard where their staff, freelancers and clients can all view a customized overview of the status of their projects.
