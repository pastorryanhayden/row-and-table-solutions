This is an internal project.  A growing suite of tools that churches purchase on a monthly or annual subscription.  We have created everything about this project - from the initial idea to the marketing copy to the apps themselves.  This is an ongoing project that we try to devote one week a month to.

If you are looking for an example of what we are capable of - this is probably the best place to start.  Check it out at [simplechurchtools.com](http://simplechurchtools.com).

Some of the things in this project:

* Web Design and Marketing Copy
* Subscription Billing
* Automated Document Creation
* Documentation
