I love the local YMCA. &nbsp;I swim there every week and even fill in as a lifeguard once a month or so. &nbsp;My kids are on the YMCA swim team (go Seals) and I've made a lot of friends there.

One of my favorite things our Y does is called "The Ironman Challenge" - once a year you sign up to compete in a full Ironman. &nbsp;The only catch is you have 8 weeks to do it. &nbsp;The Ironman challenge was actually my first taste of Triathlons, and the thing that first got me into swimming.

So imagine my excitement when the Y contacted Row and Table and asked us to make them an app to automate and track the Ironman challenge. &nbsp;The only catch - the Ironman challenge starts in two weeks.

Here is what we came up with:

Airtable for administration

We setup a simple Airtable base with three tables: A participants table for storing participants names, a four digit pin, and other details. &nbsp;A workouts table tied to the participants for recording individual workouts with a time stamp, and a quote table.

Airtable is perfect for something like this. &nbsp;The front desk staff record information when a member signs up for the challenge, and the fitness director can easily add and change participants, update or correct a workout, etc. or add a motivational quote.
