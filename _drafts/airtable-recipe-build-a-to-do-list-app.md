In these videos, we walk you through building a basic Airtable project that is both useful and powerful: A To Do List.

But this isn't just ANY to do list, it's a to do list that...

* Is totally flexible
* Can work with a "Trello" like kanban view.
* Has a calendar view for upcoming due tasks.
* Has a projects category.
* Is collaborative.

The best part - we build this using a free tool in less than 20 minutes.

Along the way you'll learn the basics of Airtable including:

1. Creating new bases
2. Adding fields
3. Basic field types
4. Adding tables with related fields
5. The collaborator field
6. Using the Kanban view
7. Using the Calendar view
8. Sharing your base with team members.
9. Sharing a view as a web page
10. Accessing your base on your phone
