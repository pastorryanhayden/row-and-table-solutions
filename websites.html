    <p>The problem with most websites is that nobody <em>(the owner, the designer or the end user)</em> has a clear idea of what the website is supposed to do.  We do.  </p>
   <blockquote>Your website is not primarily a vehicle for designers to practice their art - <strong>it is a tool for generating customers.</strong></blockquote>

    <p>We are <strong>absolutely obsessed</strong> with making sure your website is easy and intuitive to update.  Time is money, and <em>time spent fighting against a non-intuitive website is a waste of your money.</em></p>
    <h4>We build content management around YOUR content.</h4>
    <p><em>We don't use the same off-the-shelf content management systems (I'm looking at you Wordpress) that other people use</em>, we use tools that allow us to build your system around YOUR content in the ways that are most intuitive for you to update it.  <em>(It will amaze you how often your site gets updated when people aren't fighting it.)</em></p> 
    <h4>Simple, Intuitive, Website Editing</h4>
    <p>Our system is as simple as it possibly could be (so it's easy to learn), but it also has great features like visual editing and drag and drop file uploading.</p>
    <h4>Secure (Like Fort Knox)</h4>
    <p>Few things stink more than having your website hacked.  <em>(There goes a weekend!)</em> Our system is inherently secure and almost impossible to hack, so you can rest assured that your website will look good.</p>
