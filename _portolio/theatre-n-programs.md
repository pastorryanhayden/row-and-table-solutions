Theatre N is a unique movie theatre in Wilmington, Delaware. &nbsp;Their business relies on putting out information about upcoming movie showings. &nbsp; One of the ways that they accomplish this is with a monthly program booklet printed and passed out to their customers. &nbsp;Before we got involved, this was a time consuming process done manually in Adobe InDesign.

We created an Airtable base that stores their upcoming films, integrated that base into their website, created an HTML page with print CSS styles to exactly mirror what they had been doing in InDesign, and then created a custom plugin to send that page to a service and receive it back as a PDF - rendering the creation of this monthly program almost automatic and saving the client multiple man-hours every week while insuring consistency.&nbsp;
