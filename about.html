<h1>Our Story</h1>

<p>Ryan tried to start a company making a custom CMS and templates for churches.  In the process, he discovered Airtable and starting using it for everything, including web development.  After some blog and forum posts, people started contacting him for help with Airtable based projects and he decided to start a company focusing on using Airtable to create custom software for companies.</p>

<p>Ryan had worked with dozens of developers but enjoyed working with Chirag more than any of them.  He asked Chirag to be our first full time employee and he's been the operational mind behind Row and Table since day one.</p>

<p>As our workload increased, Ryan decided that it was best for our company to step away from coding and focus on project management and client interaction so he brought on Estevan, a friend from previous projects he had done, as our second employee to do much of the work he was doing.</p>

<p>We stay very busy. We've been at this for less than a year - but we've seen steady growth every month and receive calls from prospective clients nearly every day.   We can forsee our small team doubling and even tripling in the next year.  If you would like us to help you with your project, please contact us today.</p>
