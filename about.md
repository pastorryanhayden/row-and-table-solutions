# Small and Scrappy

We are super small - currently just two full time employees.

## Ryan Hayden
### Design and Customer Interaction

Ryan has been designing websites since his junior year of college (2004) and is in love with Airtable and app design.  When he isn't writing code or designing apps he serves as a pastor in his local church and spends time with his wife and three awesome kids.  He also helps coach a swim team and occasionally runs triathlons and marathons.

## Chirag Parekh 
## Development

Chirag is a development rockstar who has been coding for nearly 10 years.  He has extensive experience in Laravel (a PHP framework) and Vue (a javascript framework) and loves seeing smaller projects to completion.

# Our Story

Ryan tried to start a company making a custom CMS and templates for churches.  In the process, he discovered Airtable and starting using it for everything, including web development.  After some blog and forum posts, people started contacting him for help with Airtable based projects and he decided to start a company focusing on using Airtable to create custom software for companies.

After working with over a dozen different freelance developers, Ryan discovered Chirag and was (and still is) super impressed with his competence and ability.  He also realized early on they work very well together so he asked Chirag to be the first employee of Row and Table.

# Growing Slow

Right now, we are very busy.  We know we may need to grow soon but want to grow slowly.  If you are a developer who would be interested in joining our team, reach out to us.
